# open-code-gen-playground
A playground for the open code gen

## How to use

In a separate terminal, pull the backend container and start it:

`docker-compose up -d`

Then start the playground by doing:

```
cd open-code-gen-playground
npm start
```


The functionality is very basic, you can edit your code in a Monaco editor window and send a prompt the backend. The response will be appended to your frontend.
